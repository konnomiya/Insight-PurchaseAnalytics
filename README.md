# Insight-PurchaseAnalytics
This project is developed in Python. As Instacart has published a [dataset](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) containing 3 million Instacart orders, the purpose is to calculate, for each department, the number of times a product was requested, number of times a product was requested for the first time and a ratio of those two numbers.
