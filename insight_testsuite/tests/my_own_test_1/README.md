This is my own test. The file order_products.csv is the same as the one in test_1, while there are less product in products.csv. 
The ouput file will be generated in the corresponding output directory and there are also error messages shown in the terminal like: 
Cannot be found in products.csv - product_id: "45918"
Cannot be found in products.csv - product_id: "46667"
Cannot be found in products.csv - product_id: "46842"
